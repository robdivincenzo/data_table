To whom it may concern:

Overview: The files in this folder are example pieces of an accordion like data table.

Goal: The goal of this very simple implementation was to take an existing table and add basic styles and features. The implementation ended up with accordion-like feel along with the feature that the table data would load via AJAX (there would be about several large tables on the web page).

Technologies: The implementation uses CSS, JavaScript, and JQuery along with the necessary HTML.

View the Work: There is a small hard-coded sample table in the included HTML file. In the fully hosted implementation, the data_table is loaded via AJAX.
